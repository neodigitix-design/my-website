# Basic Website

Starter files: index.html, index.css, index.js

How to use:

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or use the VS Code Live Server extension to serve and auto-refresh.

This project provides a minimal semantic HTML structure, a small stylesheet, and a tiny JS file for basic interactivity.
